# Physics Informed Neural Network(PINN) for solving Bubble Dynamics.(In progress)

The Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) merges neural networks (NN) with partial differential equations (PDEs), enabling direct solutions to intricate physical problems without strict dependence on labeled data. This cutting-edge approach synthesizes PDE principles with NN architecture to accurately predict system behavior, proving invaluable across diverse scientific and engineering domains.

This paper introduces strategies to enhance PINN approximating capabilities. Specifically, the study focuses on applying these enhanced PINNs to solve complex problems related to rising bubble systems with free boundaries(moving boundaries as time goes by), employing a time-adaptive approach in conjunction with the level set method. By simulating using the PINN framework and comparing outcomes with existing results, the research aims to assess qualitative patterns and identify potential novel insights. Furthermore, utilizing existing data to validate accuracy and refine the network through the PINN procedure may reveal convergence among different methods and shed light on the true behavior of the system. Additionally, exploring the Deep Ritz method, which shares similarities with PINNs, could provide deeper insights into the underlying energy minimization associated with the problem when compared against PINN outcomes.
