#  Deep learning and Neural Network

This repository is collection of notes for learning skills for Neural Network and Deep learning, basically focused on improving Physics Informed Neural Network(PINN) skill.

The Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) merges neural networks (NN) with partial differential equations (PDEs), enabling direct solutions to intricate physical problems without strict dependence on labeled data. This cutting-edge approach synthesizes PDE principles with NN architecture to accurately predict system behavior, proving invaluable across diverse scientific and engineering domains.
