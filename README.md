# Physics Informed Neural Network(PINN) for solving Bubble Dynamics.(In progress)

The Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) merges neural networks (NN) with partial differential equations (PDEs), enabling direct solutions to intricate physical problems without strict dependence on labeled data. This cutting-edge approach synthesizes PDE principles with NN architecture to accurately predict system behavior, proving invaluable across diverse scientific and engineering domains.
